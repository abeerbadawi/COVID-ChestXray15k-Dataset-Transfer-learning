# COVID-ChestXray15k-Dataset-Transfer-learning

# The contributions of this paper are as follows:
•We  propose  new  modified  three  pre-trained  deep  learning  models  with  transfer learning  based  on  Dense-Net201,  VGG16,  and  VGG19  to  detect  COVID-19  from X-ray images.

•We introduce a balanced dataset named COVID-ChestXray-15k, collected from eleven publicly available datasets. We also use different data augmentation techniques to create this balanced dataset by increasing the COVID-19 images from 4420 to 5000 images. This provides a dataset with a total of 15,000 images (5000 normal, 5000 pneumonia and5000 COVID-19)

# Dataset sources:
We choose these eleven datasets because they are open source and fully available to the researchers:
•Normal images:

1- ChestX-ray8 dataset [1], with a total of 5000 images.

•Pneumonia images:

2- Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset [2], with a total of 4237 images, and 763 images from ChestX-ray8 dataset.[1].

•COVID-19 images:

3- BIMCV-COVID19 dataset [3], with a total of 2473 images.

4- COVID-19 Image Data Collection [4], with a total of 208 images.

5- COVID-19 data from Figure 1 COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset [5], with a total of55 images.

6- COVID-19 data from the ActualMed COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset [6], with atotal of 238 images.

7- SIRM database [7], with a total of 68 images.

8- Twitter data [8], with a total of 37 images.

9- COVID-19 Repository [9], with a total of 243 images.

10- COVID-CXNet [10], with a total of 877 images.

11- MOMA-Dataset [11], with a total of 221 images.
