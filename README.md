# COVID-ChestXray15k-Dataset-Transfer-learning
In this study, we use chest X-ray images from normal, pneumonia and COVID-19cases.  We collect eleven publicly available sub-databases to create one database calledthe COVID-ChestXray-15k dataset with a total of 4420 COVID-19 images before data aug-mentation, 5000 Pneumonia images, and 5000 normal images. We combine and modifyeleven different public data from ChestX-ray8 dataset [25], Chest X-Ray Images (pneu-monia) dataset [26], BIMCV-COVID19 dataset [27], COVID-19 Image Data Collection [28],Figure 1 COVID -19 Chest X-ray Dataset Initiative [29], ActualMed COVID-19 Chest X-rayDataset Initiative [30], SIRM COVID-19 database [31], Twitter COVID-19 CXR Dataset [32],Covid19 Image Repository [33], COVID-CXNet [34], and MOMA- Dataset [35]. We choosethese eleven datasets because they are open source and fully available to the researchers asshown in Table 1:•Normal images:1—ChestX-ray8 dataset [25], with a total of 5000 images.•Pneumonia images:
